This no-churn Jello Rainbow Sherbet Ice Cream is a super creamy, fruity, fun, and easy dessert…and you don’t need an ice cream maker to make it!

All you need is 5 simple ingredients and about 10 minutes of prep time, and this delicious jello ice cream is ready to pop in the freezer. The hardest part is the waiting (but it’ll be totally worth it)!

Two of the most popular recipes here on the blog, especially when the weather starts to warm up, are my Pistachio Pudding Homemade Ice Cream, which is flavored with pistachio instant pudding mix, and my Easy No-Churn Ice Cream.

They’re also two of my most favorite homemade ice cream recipes ever. Why? Because they’re both so rich, creamy, flavorful, and EASY!

A while back, one of my readers asked if lime jello could be substituted for the pudding mix in the pistachio pudding ice cream to make a key-lime-esque ice cream.

At the time, I honestly didn’t know. But it sounded like a great idea, and it has lingered in the back of my mind ever since. It sounded similar to sherbet – which I love – so I knew I had to try it.

And now that the weather is getting much warmer and summer is almost here, I figured it was the perfect time!

I didn’t feel like lugging out the ice cream maker for this one, so I decided to use the no-churn ice cream as my base instead and add the gelatin to that.

But instead of one flavor of gelatin, I decided to go with three – raspberry, orange and lime – and swirl them all together as a nod to my favorite rainbow sherbet (this recipe isn’t actually sherbet since it’s made mostly with cream and there’s no fruit or fruit juice).

Well, it turned out fantastic, and I’m so excited to share the recipe with you today (and a big thanks goes out to my reader Lauren for the inspiration)!

## Ingredients

- 2 cups heavy whipping cream, make sure it is very cold
- 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 2 tablespoons raspberry gelatin dessert mix, such as Jell-O
- 2 tablespoons orange gelatin dessert mix
- 2 tablespoons lime gelatin dessert mix

## Instructions

1. Place the heavy whipping cream and the sweetened condensed milk in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.
2. You can use an electric hand mixer and mixing bowl instead of a stand mixer.
3. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds to a minute, just until the cream starts to thicken slightly (this will help prevent the cream from splashing out of the bowl). Then turn the speed up to high and beat just until stiff peaks form (when you pull the whisk out of the cream, it should form peaks that stand up straight and don't droop over). This should take about 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Be very careful not to over-beat the mixture, as the cream can begin to separate, become grainy, and start to turn into butter.
5. Divide the whipped cream mixture evenly among three bowls.
6. Add the raspberry gelatin to first bowl, the orange gelatin to the second bowl, and the lime gelatin to the third bowl.
7. One bowl at a time, gently fold the gelatin into the whipped cream mixture until it is thoroughly combined and one solid color (by gently folding, you will keep as much air as possible in the whipped cream).
8. In a 1½-quart (6-cup) freezer-safe container with a lid (I use a glass 9×5-inch loaf pan that came with a lid), randomly place spoonfuls of each flavor of the cream mixture (you will have several layers), scattering them so that you don't have too much of any one flavor in the same spot.
9. Use a butter knife to gently swirl the flavors.
10. Cover the sherbet with plastic wrap and then put the lid on the container. Freeze for at least 8 hours or until firm.

## Notes

- You could use any flavors of gelatin that you want.
- You could also just make the entire batch one flavor if you’d rather. Use one 3-ounce box of gelatin (it’s about 5 tablespoons instead of 6, but it should be enough to give you good flavor).
- This ice cream doesn’t get super hard (perhaps the gelatin keeps it softer), so it scoops very easily right out of the freezer.
- Keeping plastic wrap on the surface of the ice cream before you put the lid on the airtight container helps keep ice crystals from forming on the surface. Do this every time you put it back in the freezer (and don’t let it sit out too long; the more it melts, the more susceptible it is to ice crystals when it goes back in).
- Properly stored, this ice cream should last up to 2 weeks in the freezer.
