If you’re a fan of classic strawberry Jell-O pretzel salad (like me), you have got to try this recipe. I took that unique combination of flavors and textures and turned it into a cheesecake, and it’s one of the most delicious desserts I’ve ever had!

So for my Mother’s Day dinner last weekend, I was looking for a new strawberry dessert recipe. My mother-in-law loves strawberries, and so every year, I always make something with strawberries just for her.

This year, my thoughts went straight to strawberry pretzel salad. I had been having a serious craving for it, and so that’s what I planned to make. But then I decided that I wanted something a little more “fancy” for such a special day.

Since the creamy filling is so similar to cheesecake, there was my answer: make it a cheesecake instead!

It was so easy to do. I just made my favorite vanilla cheesecake with a pretzel crust instead of the usual vanilla wafer crust, and then I topped it with the simple homemade fresh strawberry sauce that I shared earlier this week.

Now, if you’re at all intimidated by the thoughts of making a homemade cheesecake, don’t be! This recipe is actually very simple (you don’t even need to mess around with a water bath). The steps are all easy, and most of the time is hands-off while the cheesecake bakes, cools, and chills.

The hardest part might just be waiting for it to chill before you can dig in!

Well, the cheesecake was a big hit and was enjoyed by everyone. It was the perfect ending to our meal. And I’m telling you…I think it tastes even better than the original dessert. This one is a keeper and a repeater, my friends!

## Ingredients

- cooking spray

## For the Pretzel Crust:

- 2 cups crushed pretzels, I use about 6 ounces of mini pretzels
- ¾ cup melted butter
- ¼ cup sugar

## For the Cheesecake:

- 3 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup sugar
- 4 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 cup sour cream, at room temperature
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

## For the Strawberry Topping:

- 1 recipe Homemade Fresh Strawberry Sauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly spray the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray.

## Make the Pretzel Crust:

1. In a large bowl, combine the crushed pretzels, melted butter, and ¼ cup sugar. Mix until well-combined.
2. Press the pretzel mixture firmly into the bottom of the pan so that it is nicely compact (I use the back of a large spoon to press it down).
3. Make the Cheesecake:
4. Place the softened cream cheese and 1 cup of sugar in a large bowl. Using an electric mixer (you can use a hand mixer or a stand mixer), beat on high speed until well-combined and the mixture is smooth.
5. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition just until the egg is blended in.
6. Note: Once you start adding the eggs, use low speed on the mixer for the rest of the recipe and just until everything is mixed together and smooth. This prevents your cheesecake batter from developing too many bubbles, which can cause cracks.
7. Add the sour cream and vanilla extract; mix on low speed just until well-combined and the batter is smooth.
8. Pour the batter into the pan over the crust.
9. Place the pan on a sheet of aluminum foil and bring the foil up the sides so that the bottom of the pan is wrapped in foil (this prevents the butter from the crust leaking out of the pan and onto the bottom of the oven and burning in the event the pan does not seal tightly; don't skip this step even if your pan says it is leak-proof!).
10. Bake for 60 to 70 minutes or until the center of the cheesecake is almost set
11. To check: Give the pan a gentle shake (or you can tap the sides of the pan with a wooden spoon). The outer edges should be firm, and the center should have just a very slight jiggle to it – it should not be very loose. The middle may also look slightly sunken in as compared to the sides. This is normal at this point. The cheesecake will even out as it cools.
12. Turn off the oven. Leave the cheesecake in the oven for 2 hours or until cooled. It will finish cooking during this time (so avoid opening the oven door, especially in the beginning), and it will cool down as well.
13. Remove the cheesecake from the oven. Cover the top of the pan with a paper towel and then with aluminum foil (the paper towel will help prevent any condensation that might form from dripping down on the cheesecake).
14. Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or until it is thoroughly chilled.

## Make the Strawberry Topping and Finish:

1. Meanwhile, make the [homemade strawberry sauce](http://localhost:3000/blog/homemade-fresh-strawberry-sauce) (<–click the link to go to the recipe); put it in the refrigerator to chill as well.
2. Gently run a knife between the cheesecake and the pan in case there is any sticking. Remove the sides of the pan. Slice the cheesecake into 12 equal pieces.
3. To serve: top each slice of cheesecake with 2 tablespoons of the strawberry sauce.

## Notes

- For a cute presentation, garnish each serving with a dollop of whipped cream, a strawberry slice, and a mini pretzel.
- One recipe of strawberry sauce will be enough for 2 tablespoons of sauce per slice of cheesecake. If you’d like more than that, make a double batch!
- Although homemade is best, you can use store-bought strawberry sauce, if desired. You will need 1½ cups.
- Store cheesecake, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 3 to 5 days.
- You can freeze cheesecake whole or you can freeze it in slices. Wrap in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil (if freezing slices, wrap each individually and put them in a freezer bag). For best results, use within 1 to 2 months.
