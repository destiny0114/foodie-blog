These Easy Red Velvet Cake Mix Cookies are big, sweet, soft, chewy, crinkly, and as delicious as they are pretty!

Red is the color of love, and these gorgeous red velvet cookies studded with white chocolate and semisweet chocolate chips are the perfect sweet treat for Valentine’s Day (and they’d also make a great Christmas cookie…or an any-old-day cookie)!

I’ve been eyeing up cake mix cookies for a while now. I finally decided to give them a try with this version because red velvet is one of my favorite cakes. Plus, I wanted to do something red for the upcoming holiday.

Now, if you’ve been following along (and thank you if you have!), you know that my recipes are mostly made from scratch with very few overly-processed ingredients. That’s just how I roll.

But hey, every now and then, we all need a few great shortcuts that make things super quick and easy. And when the results are this dang delicious, you’ve just gotta go with it!

Let’s review, shall we? Ingredients needed: 5. Bowls needed: 1 (hello, easy clean-up!). Mixers needed: 0. Time needed: 10 minutes to prep, 12 minutes to bake each sheet, plus a little extra time to let them cool off. Rating: 5 out of 5 stars!

Let me tell you, these babies taste just as good as any totally-from-scratch cookie that I’ve ever made. They are officially my new favorite cookies!

Being that they’re made with cake mix, you might think that they would have a cakey texture (I did), but they don’t. They’re perfectly soft and chewy…just like a good cookie should be!

## Ingredients

- 1 (15.25-ounce) box red velvet cake mix
- 2 large eggs
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- ½ cup white chocolate chips
- ½ cup semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, stir together the red velvet cake mix, eggs, and vegetable oil until well-combined. Note: The dough will be rather stiff and sticky and a little shiny. This is totally normal!
3. Add the chocolate chips and stir them in until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.
4. Using a heaping tablespoon for each cookie, roll the dough into balls and place them on the baking sheets at least 2 inches apart (they will spread quite a bit during baking). I do one dozen on one sheet and the rest on the other.
5. For a prettier presentation, add a few extra chips to the tops of the dough balls. This is optional, but it really does make the cookies look nice!
6. Bake each sheet (use the center rack of the oven) for 10 to 12 minutes or until the tops are set (they look dry) and the cookies have begun to develop cracks. Note: I recommend baking one sheet at a time so that the cookies bake evenly. If you put both sheets in the oven at the same time on different racks, you might get inconsistent results.
7. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.

## Notes

- I love the combination of both white and semisweet chocolate chips, but you could do 1 cup of one or the other if you’d prefer (or you could do no chips at all).
- Store cookies in an airtight container for up to 3 to 5 days.
- Yes, these cookies are freezable!
- These cookies are totally customizable! Try different flavors of cake mix along with any mix-ins you’d like.
